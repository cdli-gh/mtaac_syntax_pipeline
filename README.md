# MTAAC Syntax Pipeline

  This contains the MTAAC pipeline for the rule-based annotation of Sumerian syntax as described by 

  [Chiarcos, C., Khait, I., Pagé-Perron, É., Schenk, N., Fäth, C., Steuer, J., ... & Wang, J. (2018). Annotating a low-resource language with LLOD technology: Sumerian morphology and syntax. Information, 9(11), 290.](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/9/11/290/pdf)

  Along with other techniques (e.g., annotation projection), this workflow was applied to produce the [Electronic Text Corpus of Syntactically Annotated Neo-Sumerian (ETCSANS)](https://github.com/cdli-gh/ETCSANS).

The syntax pipeline has been developed in the project "Machine Translation and Automated Annotation of Cuneiform Languages" (MTAAC, 2017-2020, funded by DFG, NEH, SSHRC).

The underlying transformation engine, [CoNLL-RDF](https://github.com/acoli-repo/conll)/[Fintan](https://github.com/Pret-a-LLOD/Fintan) has been developed in the context of the project "Linked Open Dictionaries" (LiODi, 2015-2022, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, BMBF) and further extended in the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Action "Pret-a-LLOD. Ready-to-use Multilingual Linked Language Data for Knowledge Services across Sectors" (ERC, 2019-2022).
